## Emmy's XBOX Series X Buttons - v1.3
> Time for a new & more detailed changelog!
### Buttons
- Updated mini-buttons to be slightly more visible and readable in certain situations.
- Dialogue mini-buttons have been improved slightly to be more visually consistent.
- Visual improvements to the Bumper/Trigger prompts.
- Slight shadowing applied to QTE buttons and mini-buttons, bringing parity with vanilla game aesthetics.
- Fixed alignment issues with certain buttons and effects.

### Loading Screen
- Completely redesigned loading screens, thanks to [Kunai](https://github.com/NextinMono/kunai)!
    - *These loading screens now completely replaces the old XBOX 360 controller guide, complete with adjusted labeling. Previously, the loading screen instructions were baked into the loading screens.*
        - *This also means that any mods that replace loading screen backgrounds will now work properly, as long as they are loaded beneath this mod!*
- Added option to choose between Light style controller (in the style of the vanilla game), or Dark style controller (adhering to the XBOX Series X default controller colour) for the loading screens. 
### Technical Changes
- Mod is now Linux-compatible! (Replaced backslashes in config file with forward slashes...)
- Further mod size and filesize optimizations.
## Emmy's XBOX Series X Buttons - v1.2

## Emmy's XBOX Series X Buttons - v1.1
- Fixed errors in configuration file, oops!
## Emmy's XBOX Series X Buttons - v1.0
